GSE65858,200065858,Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression beadchip;,Gene expression patterns and TP53 mutations are associated with HPV RNA status lymph node metastasis and survival in head and neck cancer,A growing proportion of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) is associated with the human papilloma virus (HPV) particularly HPV16. We compare tumors with different HPV16 DNA and RNA (E6*I) status from 290 consecutively recruited HNSCC patients by gene expression profiling and targeted sequencing of 50 genes. We confirm that the HPV16 DNA+ RNA+ tumors are molecularly distinct from the HPV-negative (DNA-) HNSCC and have elevated expression of cell cycle genes and rare TP53 mutations (3.6% 1/28). We show that tumors with non-transcriptionally active HPV16 (DNA+ RNA-) are similar to HPV DNA- tumors regarding gene expression and frequency of TP53 mutations (47% 8/17 and 43% 72/167 respectively). Furthermore we identify four gene expression clusters. They moderately but significantly differ in overall survival. One cluster exhibits high expression of immune response genes (IR) and contains most of the HPV16 DNA+ RNA+ patients. The IR cluster and disruptive TP53 mutations are associated with lymph node metastasis independent of HPV16 status and we validate each of these associations in another large data set. Consistent with earlier studies disruptive TP53 mutations are prognostically unfavorable. Our findings underscore the importance of measuring the HPV16 RNA (E6*I) and TP53-mutation status for patient stratification and for the first time identify associations of an immune response-related gene expression cluster and TP53 mutations with lymph node metastasis in HNSCC.,Homo sapiens,Microarray,26095926,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE65858,270,Y,Y,Y,Y,Y,Y,Y,,Y,Y,,Y,Y,Y,Y,Y,Y,15,

A multi-scale omics approach based on whole-exome sequencing global DNA methylation and gene expression profiling data derived from tumor samples of the HIPO-HNC cohort was conducted and new findings were confirmed with data from TCGA-HNC. Results provide experimental evidence that the ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2) exhibits variable promoter methylation and expression in both tumor samples and HNSCC cell lines. Moreover immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections unraveled a gradual loss of RYR2 expression from normal mucosa via dysplastic lesions to cancer and indicated that reduced RYR2 expression in adjacent tissue and precancer lesions might serve as a risk factor for unfavorable prognosis and upcoming malignant conversion.,Homo sapiens,Microarray,32161122,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE117973,77,Y,Y,,Y,Y,Y,Y,,Y,Y,,Y,Y,,,Y,Y,12,
GSE53355,200053355,[HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array;,Preserving biological heterogeneity with personalized genomics batch correction,Motivation: Sample source procurement process and other technical variations introduce batch effects into genomics data. Algorithms to remove these artifacts enhance differences between known biological covariates but also carry potential concern of removing intra-group biological heterogeneity and thus any personalized genomic signatures. As a result accurate identification of novel subtypes from batch corrected genomics data is challenging using standard algorithms designed to remove batch effects for class comparison analyses. Nor can batch effects be corrected reliably in future applications of genomics-based clinical tests in which the biological groups are by definition unknown a priori. Results: Therefore we introduce new algorithm personalized-SVA (pSVA) blind to biological covariates corrected technical artifacts while retaining biological heterogeneity in genomic data. This algorithm facilitated accurate subtype identification in head and neck cancer from gene expression data in both formalin fixed and frozen samples. When applied to predict HPV status pSVA improved cross- study validation even if the sample batches were highly confounded with HPV status in the training set.

In squamous cell carcinomas of head and neck upregulation of galectin-1 presence is highly significantly correlated to presence of smooth muscle actin-positive cancer-associated fibroblasts in the tumor. In order to pinpoint correlations on the molecular level we applied microarray analyses to the transcription profiles of the corresponding tumors. Significant correlations of several transcripts were detected with the protein level of galectin-1 in the cancer-associated fibroblasts.,Homo sapiens,Microarray,22447203,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-850,32,,Y,,,Y,,,,Y,Y,Y,Y,Y,,Y,Y,Y,10,

Aberrant hypermethylation in the promoter region of some known or putative tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) occurs frequently during the development of various cancers including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In this study we used an expanded mRNA expression profiling approach followed by microarray expression analysis to identify epigenetically inactivated genes in HNSCC. Two HNSCC cell lines were treated with 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine followed by microarray analysis to identify epigenetically silenced genes in HNSCC. 1960 614 and 427 genes were upregulated in HNSCC cell lines JHU-012 JHU-011 and the combination of both cell lines respectively. HNSCC tumor and normal mucosal samples were used for gene profiling by a 47K mRNA gene expression array and we found 7140 genes were downregulated in HNSCC tumors compared to normal mucosa as determined by microarray analysis and were integrated with cell line data. Integrative analysis defined 126 candidate genes of which only seven genes showed differentially methylation in tumors and no methylation in normal mucosa after bisulfite sequencing. After validation by QMSP one gene GNG7 was confirmed as being highly methylated in tumors and unmethylated in normal mucosal and salivary rinse samples demonstrating cancer-specific methylation in HNSCC tissues. TXNIP and TUSC2 were partially methylated in tumors and normal salivary rinses but unmethylated in normal mucosa. We concluded GNG7 as a highly specific promoter methylated gene associated with HNSCC. In addition TXNIP and TUSC2 are also potential biomarkers for HNSCC.,Homo sapiens,Microarray,23403885,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE29330,18,,,,,,,,,Y,Y,Y,Y,Y,,Y,Y,Y,8,

GSE6791,200006791,[HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array;,Gene Expression Profiles of HPV-Positive and -Negative Head/Neck and Cervical Cancers,Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are associated with nearly all cervical cancers (CCs) 20-30% of head and neck cancers (HNCs) and other cancers. Because HNCs also arise in HPV-negative patients this type of cancer provides unique opportunities to define similarities and differences of HPV-positive versus HPV-negative cancers arising in the same tissue.  Here we describe genome-wide expression profiling of 84 HNCs CCs and site-matched normal epithelial samples in which we used laser capture microdissection to enrich samples for tumor-derived versus normal epithelial cells.  This analysis revealed that HPV+HNCs and CCs differed in their patterns of gene expression yet shared many changes compared to HPV-HNCs. Some of these shared changes were predicted but many others were not. Notably HPV+HNCs and CCs were found to be upregulated in their expression of a distinct and larger subset of cell cycle genes than observed in HPV-HNC.  Moreover HPV+ cancers over-expressed testis-specific genes that are normally expressed only in meiotic cells.  Many though not all of the hallmark differences between HPV+HNC and HPV-HNC were a direct consequence of HPV and in particular the viral E6 and E7 oncogenes. This included a novel association of HPV oncogenes with testes specific gene expression. These findings in primary human tumors provide novel biomarkers for early detection of HPV+ and HPV- cancers and emphasize the potential value of targeting E6 and E7 function alone or combined with radiation and/or traditional chemotherapy in the treatment of HPV+ cancers.

We sought to determine whether the presence of metastasis in the regional lymph node could be predicted by a gene expression signature of the primary tumor. A total of 18 OSCCs were characterized for gene expression by hybridizing RNA to Affymetrix U133A gene chips. Genes with differential expression were identified using a permutation technique and verified by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. A predictive rule was built using a support vector machine and the accuracy of the rule was evaluated using crossvalidation on the original data set and prediction of an independent set of four patients. Metastatic primary tumors could be differentiated from nonmetastatic primary tumors by a signature gene set of 116 genes. This signature gene set correctly predicted the four independent patients as well as associating five lymph node metastases from the original patient set with the metastatic primary tumor group. We concluded that lymph node metastasis could be predicted by gene expression profiles of primary oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas. The presence of a gene expression signature for lymph node metastasis indicates that clinical testing to assess risk for lymph node metastasis should be possible.

Although certain risk factors such as smoking status and histology are known our ability to predict oral cancer risk remains poor.  The study objective was to determine the value of gene expression profiling in predicting oral cancer development. Gene expression profile was measured in 86 of 162 OPL patients who were enrolled in a clinical chemoprevention trial that used the incidence of oral cancer development as a prespecified endpoint. The median follow-up time was 6.08 years and 35 of the 86 patients developed oral cancer over the course. Gene  expression profiles were associated with oral cancer-free survival and used to develope multivariate predictive models for oral cancer prediction. We developed a 29-transcript predictive model which showed marked improvement in terms of prediction accuracy (with 8% predicting error rate) over the models using previously known clinico-pathological risk factors. Based on the gene expression profile data we also identified 2182 transcripts significantly associated with oral cancer risk associated genes (P-value<0.01 single variate Cox proportional hazards model). Functional pathway analysis revealed proteasome machinery MYC and ribosomes components as the top gene sets associated with oral cancer risk.

Methods: A total number of 10 patients who underwent surgery for primary laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma were recruited for microarray analysis. LSCC tissues compared with corresponding adjacent non-neoplastic tissues were analysed by Illumina mRNA microarraysand LSCC tissues with regional lymph node metastasis and LSCC tissues without regional lymph node metastasis were analyzed in the same manner.The most frequently differently expressed genes screened by microarrays were also validated by qRT-PCR in another 42 patients diagnosed for LSCC .  Results: Analysed by Illumina mRNA microarraysthere were 361 genes significantly related to tumorigenesis while 246 genes significantly related to regional lymph node metastasis in LSCC.

HPV-associated OPC have better prognosis and a more favorable response to therapy as compared to HPV-negative tumors. Viral oncoproteins are capable of transforming primary human keratinocytes from either genital or oral epithelia in vitro and most likely play the same role in vivo by disrupting cell-cycle regulatory pathways leading to a genetic progression to ano-genital cancer and OPC.

HPV-associated OPC have better prognosis and a more favorable response to therapy as compared to HPV-negative tumors. Viral oncoproteins are capable of transforming primary human keratinocytes from either genital or oral epithelia in vitro and most likely play the same role in vivo by disrupting cell-cycle regulatory pathways leading to a genetic progression to ano-genital cancer and OPC. However the precise mechanisms by which HPV mediates malignant transformation of keratinocytes in the upper digestive tract epithelia are not entirely clear.  HPV E7-mediated inactivation of pRb results in overexpression of p16INK4A which is commonly used as a clinical surrogate marker for HPV positivity/activity. However high p16INK4A alone has insufficient sensitivity and specificity as a biomarker of HPV positivity in different mucosal sub-sites of HNC. Therefore increasing emphasis is being placed on the assessment of viral load and E7 oncogene expression resulting in further classification of HPV positive OPC as HPV-active and HPV-inactive.

Our study design was guided by the hypothesis that the expression of genes present in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) but not in healthy oral tissues would be indicative of recurrence in advance of histological alteration. We used meta-analysis of five published microarray data sets (GEO accession GDS2520 Kuriakose et al. 2004; GDS1584 Toruner et al. 2004; GSE6791 Pyeon et al. 2007; GSE9844 Ye et al. 2008; and GSE10121 Sticht et al. 2008) in conjunction with the current training set to identify genes reliably over-expressed in OSCC. This reduced gene set was used to train a risk model to predict recurrence based on over-expression of a subset of these genes in histologically normal surgical resection margins.

To understand a molecular mechanism of endophytic subtype and identify biomarkers we performed comprehensive microarray analysis for mRNAs from clinical biopsy sampleswhich were classified into subtypes and found overexpression of parvin-beta (PARVB) gene significantly related to endophytic type. PARVB is known to play a critical role in actin reorganization and focal adhesions. Knocking down PARVB expression in vitrocaused apparent decreases in cell migration and wound healing implying that PARVB has a crucial role in cellular motility. Moreover metastasis-free survival was significantly lowered in patients with higher PARVB expression. Therefore overexpression of PARVB is a candidate biomarker for endophytic tumor and metastasis and may be clinically applicable for decision making of an adjuvant therapy in TSCC.,Homo sapiens,Microarray,25422907,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52915,27,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,Y,,,Y,,3,

Despite advances in surgery and chemo-radiotherapy the 5 year survival has remained roughly constant at approximately 50% for several decades.  The disease is characterized by both clinical and genetic heterogeneity so elucidating the molecular basis of this heterogeneity would have significant clinical implications.  It is well recognized that OSCCs from Asia that are associated with betel quid chewing are phenotypically distinct from those from the West that are predominantly caused by smoking/drinking but the genetic basis of these differences are largely unknown. The aim of this study is to examine the most related genetic factors carcinogenic related pathways and molecular processes that might be responsible for the phenotypic heterogeneity of OSCC between UK and Sri Lankan population groups.   Methods: We have compared the gene expression profiles of OSCCs and normal oral mucosal tissues from both Sri Lankan and UK individuals using Affymetrix gene expression arrays. Results: The gene expression profiles of UK and Sri Lankan OSCC are similar in many respects to other oral cancer expression profiles reported in the literature and were mainly similar to each other.  However genes involved in tumor invasion metastasis and recurrence were more obviously associated with UK tumors as opposed to those from Sri Lanka.  Interestingly Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed a highly activated cell-mediated immune response in both Sri Lankan normal and tumor samples relative to UK cohorts which may in part explain the less aggressive behavior of these betel quid-induced OSCCs.  Conclusion: The development of OSCCs in both UK and Sri Lankan populations appears largely mediated by similar biological pathways despite the differences related to race ethnicity lifestyle and/or exposure to environmental carcinogens. However IPA revealed a highly activated “Cell-mediated Immune Response” in Sri Lankan normal and tumor samples relative to UK cohorts. It seems likely therefore that any future attempts to personalize treatment for OSCC patients will need to be different in Western and Asian countries to reflect differences in gene expression and the immune status of the patients.,Homo sapiens,Microarray,25560800,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE51010,56,Y,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,Y,,3,
GSE27020,200027020,[HG-U133A] Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array;,Identification and validation of a multigene predictor of recurrence in primary laryngeal cancer.,Background: Local recurrence is the major manifestation of treatment failure in patients with operable laryngeal carcinoma. Established clinicopathological factors cannot sufficiently predict patients that are likely to recur after treatment. Additional tools are therefore required to accurately identify patients at high risk for recurrence.  Methods: Using Affymetrix U133A Genechips we profiled fresh-frozen tumor tissues from 59 patients with operable laryngeal cancer. All patients were treated locally with surgery with or without radiation therapy. We performed Cox regression proportional hazards modeling to identify multigene predictors of recurrence. The end-point of our analysis was disease-free survival (DFS). Gene models were directly validated in a separate similarly treated cohort of 50 patients using Affymetrix chips. In an attempt to further validate our results we profiled 12 selected genes of our model in formalin-fixed tumor tissues from an independent cohort of 75 patients using quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).   Results: We focused on genes univariately associated with DFS (p&lt;0.05) in the training set. Among several gene models comprising different numbers of genes a 30-gene model demonstrated optimal performance (log-rank p&lt;0.001). We directly applied these gene models to the validation set after adjusting for non-biological experimental variability and observed similar results. Specifically median DFS as predicted by the 30-gene model was 34 and 80 months for high- and low-risk patients respectively (p=0.01). Hazard Ratio (HR) for recurrence for the high-risk group was 3.87 (95% CI 1.28-11.73 p=0.017). Furthermore unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the 75 patients based on the qRT-PCR 12-gene profile yielded two groups which differed significantly in DFS (log-rank p=0.027). HR= for recurrence was 2.26 (95% CI 1.08-4.76 p=0.031).  Conclusion: We have established and validated gene models that can successfully stratify patients with laryngeal cancer based on their risk for recurrence. Thus patients with unfavorable prognosis when accurately identified could be ideal candidates for the application of more aggressive treatment modalities.,Homo sapiens,Microarray,23950933,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE27020,109,Y,,,,Y,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,3,

Survival of LSCC patients has been found worsening albeit significant advances in technology and therapeutics were made. We sought to clarify new genetic targets driven the development of LSCC. Analyzing tumors revealed that eight members of the homeobox gene family (HOX) were expressed 200 times more in LSCC samples than in normal larynx tissue. qPCR analysis validated all transcriptomic findings for the HOX gene family. Receiver Operating Characteristic statistical method (ROC curve) predicted that 8 members of the HOX gene family differentiate tumors from their normal surrounding tissue. Enabling the comparison of patient clinics with gene expression data ROC curve analysis yet revealed that HOXC8 and HOXD11 genes are related to the tumor differentiation degree and regional lymph node metastasis respectively. From siRNA assay we found that HOXC8 and HOXD11 genes are essential for the expansion of FADU cell colonies.

Gene expression models prognostic of recurrence risk could suggest which patients with early stage laryngeal cancer would be more appropriate for testing adjuvant strategies.  Patients and Methods Expression profiling using whole genome DASL arrays was performed on 56 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples of patients with early stage laryngeal cancer treated with surgery or radiation therapy. We split the samples into a training set and a validation set. Using the supervised principal components survival analysis in the first cohort we identified multiple gene expression profiles that predict the risk of recurrence. These profiles were then validated in the second independent cohort.  Results Gene models comprising different number of genes (40-100) identified a subgroup of patients who were at high risk of recurrence. Of these the best prognostic model distinguished between a high- and a low-risk group (median DFS: 92 and 123 months log rank p&lt;0.005 permutation p&lt;0.05) Hazard Ratio (HR): 8.51 (95% CI 1.01 to 71.77; p&lt;0.05).

We studied the expression profile of 63 pre-treatment tumor biopsies obtained from locally advanced HNSCCs treated with standard treatments. Cluster analysis identified three tumor subtypes associated with significant differences in local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) progression free-survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Tumor subtype 1 associated with short LRFS PFS and OS showed features of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and undifferentiation. It also overexpressed genes involved in cell adhesion NF-_B and integrin signalling. Tumor subtype 3 associated with longer LRFS PFS and OS showed a high degree of differentiation and overexpressed genes located in chromosomal regions 19q13 and 1q21. Tumor subtype 2 which had a clinical outcome intermediate between subtype 1 and subtype 3 overexpressed genes involved in branching morphogenesis. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis identified a subset of genes associated with local recurrence and survival. We validated the association between gene cluster classification and patient survival using two HNSCC data sets obtained from two independent patient cohorts.

Interrogation of global DNA methylation patterns for such specimens has not been reported though such analyses are needed to uncover novel molecular factors driving disease. Materials and Methods: We evaluated global DNA methylation patterns for 30 biopsies obtained from 10 patients undergoing surgical removal of an OSCC or carcinoma in situ (CIS). From a disease field in each patient we collected i) dysplastic ii) CIS or OSCC and iii) adjacent normal biopsies. DNA isolated from each biopsy was profiled for methylation status using the Illumina HumanMethylation27K platform. Results: Our data demonstrate that aberrant methylation of promoter CpG islands exists across oral precancer and OSCC genomes. Non-hierarchical clustering of all methylation data revealed distinct methylation patterns between the normal and the CIS/OSCC tissues (with results for dysplastic biopsies split between groups).  Multiple genes exhibiting recurrent aberrant DNA methylation were found for both dysplastic and CIS/OSCC groups and included enrichment for genes found in the WNT and MAPK signaling pathways. Conclusion: In identifying aberrant DNA methylation at the earliest stages of oral precancer and finding recurring epigenetic disruption of specific genes/pathways across our analyzed cohort we conclude that CpG methylation changes are a hallmark of oral cancer progression and that global DNA methylation analyses are an essential component for wider studies seeking to derive biomarkers or potentially druggable targets for improving oral cancer outcomes.,Homo sapiens,Microarray,24035722 25060540,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE46802,60,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,,,Y,,2,used series matrix because it was the same as the raw data

Methods: The gene expression profile of patients (n=37) with oral tongue SCC were analyzed using Affymetrix HG_U95Av2 high-density oligonucleotide arrays. Hierarchical clustering analyses failed to show significant segregation of patients. In patients (n=20) with available tumor and matched normal mucosa 77 genes were found to be differentially expressed (P&lt; 0.05) in the tongue tumor samples compared to their matched normal controls.  Among the 45 over-expressed genes MMP-1 encoding interstitial collagenase showed the highest level of increase (average: 34.18 folds). The 20 patients were then grouped into stage (early vs. late) and nodal disease (node positive vs. node negative) subgroups and genes differentially expressed in tumor vs. normal and between the subgroups were identified. Three genes GLUT3 HSAL2 and PACE4 were selected for their potential biological significance in a larger cohort of 49 patients by quantitative real-time RT-PCR.    Results: Using the criterion of two-fold or greater as overexpression 30.6% 24.5% and 26.5% of patients showed high levels of GLUT3 HSAL2 and PACE4 respectively.  Univariate analyses demonstrated that GLUT3 over-expression correlated with depth of invasion (P&lt;0.0001) tumor size (P=0.024) pathological stage (P=0.009) and recurrence (P=0.038).  HSAL2 was positively associated with depth of invasion (P=0.015) and advanced T stage (P=0.0467).   In survival studies only GLUT3 showed a prognostic value with disease-specific (P=0.049) relapse-free (P-0.0042) and overall survival (P=0.003).  PACE4 mRNA expression failed to show correlation with any of the relevant parameters.   Conclusions: The characterization of genes identified to be significant predictors of prognosis by oligonucleotide microarray and further validation by real-time RT-PCR offers a powerful strategy for identification of novel targets for prognostication and treatment of oral tongue carcinoma.

By analyzing gene expression profiles of a selected retrospective series of HNSCC patients treated with cetuximab an anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody (MAb) associated to chemotherapy we were able to propose that long progression-free survival (PFS) cases consistently belong to defined molecular subtypes such as Cluster3-hypoxia and Basal subtypes respectively defined by De Cecco et al [DeCecco; Oncotarget 2015] and Keck et al [Keck; CCR2015] while short-PFS cases are characterized by an over-activation of RAS signaling,Homo sapiens,Microarray,29909889,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE102995,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,,,,,1,

A stringent multi-test approach combining 7 traditional and microarray-specific statistical tests was used to analyze the resultant data. Candidate genes were assigned to tiers of significance based on the number of statistical tests that each gene satisfied. Representative genes (both up-regulated and down-regulated) from each of the 3 tiers would be quantified with RT-PCR on both microarray-tested and new samples of HNSCC. The goal of this study is to identify reliable differentially-expressed genes on HNSCC and to testify our hypothesis whether or not a combinatorial approach (multi-tests) to analyzing microarray data can really identify differentially-expressed genes with fewer false-positives.

GSE3292,200003292,[HG-U133_Plus_2] Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array;,Gene expression signature of HPV in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Introduction: Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is associated with a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) between 15% and 35% of HNSCC harboring HPV almost exclusively of subtype 16. Demographic and exposure differences between HPV-positive (+) and negative (-) HNSCCs suggest that HPV(+) tumors may constitute a subclass with different biology while clinical differences have also been observed. In this study gene expression profiles of HPV(+) and (-) tumors were compared to further explore the biological effect of HPV in HNSCC. Methods: Thirty-six HNSCC tumors were analyzed for gene expression using Affymetrix Human 133U Plus 2.0 GeneChip and for HPV using consensus primers for HPV L1 E6 and E7 by PCR and RT-PCR. Results: Eight (22%) of 36 tumors were positive for HPV all of the HPV 16 subtype and the HPV positive samples also expressed viral HPV E6 mRNA determined by RT-PCR. Patients with HPV(+) HNSCCs were on average younger than those with HPV(-) tumors (mean age 50.2 vs. 58.7). Statistical analysis using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) based on HPV status as a supervising parameter resulted in a list of 91 genes that were differentially expressed with statistical significance. Results for a sub-set of these genes were verified by RT-PCR. Genes highly expressed in HPV(+) samples included cell cycle regulators (p16INK4A p18 and CDK2) and transcription factors (TAF7L RFC4 RPA2 and TFDP2). The microarray data were also investigated using DIGMap to map genes by chromosomal location. A large number of genes on chromosome 3q24-qter was found to be overrepresented in HPV(+) tumors. Conclusion: The gene expression profile associated with HPV reflects alterations in cell cycle and proliferation signals. Further investigation of differentially expressed genes may reveal the unique pathways in HPV(+) tumors that may explain the different natural history and biological properties of these tumors. These properties may be exploited as a target of novel therapeutic agents in HNSCC treatment.

GSE2837,200002837,[U133_X3P] Affymetrix Human X3P Array;,Survival Prediction of HNSCC using FFPE samples,Recently it was shown that gene expression signatures generated from DNA microarray analyses have promise as biomarkers of clinical outcome and that the molecular characteristics of tumors could be elucidated. Through this study we have determined a high-risk signature for recurrence as a prognostic biomarker using formalin-fixed HNSCC tumors and tested the results to an independent data set obtained from fresh frozen tumors as a comparison. Also we have shown the genes that are involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition and nuclear factor-_B signaling deregulation are the most prominent molecular characteristics of the high-risk tumors. Forty samples including 34 formalin-fixed tissues and 6 matched frozen tissues from 29 HNSCC patients were analyzed for gene expression. The formalin-fixed tumors were classified based on their gene expression by intrinsic analysis and the intrinsic gene list was tested on the classification of previously published 60 frozen HNSCC tumors which highly correlated. Based on the molecular classification a 75-gene list that is predictive of high-risk for recurrence was determined by training on the formalin-fixed tumor set and tested on the independent frozen tumor set. The difference in recurrence-free survival (RFS) between the high-risk vs. low-risk groups in the training and test sets were statistically significant (Log-rank test p=0.002 and p=0.03 respectively). Also the gene expression data was interrogated using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to determine functional significance. The most significant sets of genes that are enriched in the high-risk tumors were genes involving epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) NF-_B activation and cell adhesion. In conclusion global gene expression analysis is feasible using formalin-fixed tissue and the data from different sample preparations and array platforms can be reliably combined for analyses. The 75-gene list can be utilized as a prognostic biomarker of recurrence and the molecular characteristics of EMT and NF-_B activation can be targeted as the novel therapy in the identified high-risk patients.

While the advent of new techniques and multimodality therapy have improved prognosis of locally HNSCC the appearance of distant metastases (DM) remains a challenge both for prognosis and treatment. To date the genomic landscape of dissemination of HNSCC has to be further studied in order to predict whether a patient will develop distant metastases. Therefore knowing that the risk of disease spread to DM is directly correlated to initial staging it suggested the hypothesis that the development of DM could be linked to the biologic characteristics of the primary tumor.  The aim of our work is to compare gene expression profile of primary tumors of patients who develop and not develop DM. Additionally we studied the expression profile of matched  distant metastasis.,Homo sapiens,Microarray,32283719,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE136037,72,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,

Recent genetic sequencing efforts have elucidated relevant genes in head and neck cancer but HPV-related tumors have consistently shown few DNA mutations. In this study we sought to analyze alternative splicing events (ASE) that could alter gene function independent of mutations. To identify ASE unique to HPV-related tumors RNA sequencing was performed on 46 HPV-positive OPSCC and 25 normal tissue samples. A novel algorithm using outlier statistics on RNA-sequencing junction expression identified 109 splicing events which were confirmed in a validation set from The Cancer Genome Atlas.,Homo sapiens,RNA-Seq,31097695,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE112026,76,Y,Y,,,,Y,,Y,Y,Y,,Y,Y,,,,,8,
GSE72536,200072536,Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens);,Gene expression analysis of TIL rich HPV driven head and neck tumours reveals a distinct B-cell signature when compared to HPV independent tumours.,Purpose: Human papilloma virus (HPV) associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has a better prognosis than HPV(-) negative cancer. This may be due in part to the higher number of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in HPV(+) tumours. We used RNAseq to evaluate whether these differences in clinical behaviour could be explained simply by a numerical difference in TILs or whether there was a fundamental difference between TILs in these two settings. Patients and methods: Twenty-three consecutive HNSCC cases with high and moderate TIL density were subjected to RNAseq analysis.  Differentially expressed genes (DEG) between 10 HPV(+) and 13 HPV(-) tumours were identified with EdgeR. Immune subset analysis was performed using FAIME (Functional Analysis of Individual Microarray Expression) and Immune gene transcript count analysis. Results: 1634 genes were differentially expressed. There was a dominant immune signature in HPV(+) tumours. After normalizing expression profiles for numerical differences in T cells and B cells 437 significantly DEGs still remained. A B-cell associated signature emerged which segregated HPV(+) from HPV(-) cancers  and included CD200 STAG3 GGA2 SPIB and ADAM28. Differential expression of these genes was confirmed  by real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. Conclusion: In our dataset the difference associated with T-cells between patients with HPV(+) and (-) HNSCC was predominantly numerical. However when TIL numbers are corrected a distinct differential B-cell signature was revealed.,Homo sapiens,RNA-Seq,27462861 30655616,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE72536,23,,,,,,Y,Y,,,,,,Y,,Y,Y,Y,6,

GSE74927,200074927,Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Homo sapiens);,Subtypes of HPV-positive head and neck cancers are associated with HPV characteristics copy number variations PIK3CA mutation and pathway signatures. [RNA-Seq],Purpose: There is substantial heterogeneity within the human papillomavirus (HPV) positive head and neck cancer (HNC) tumors that predispose them to different outcomes however this subgroup is poorly characterized due to various historical reasons.  Experimental Design: we perform unsupervised gene expression clustering on well-annotated HPV(+) HNC samples from two cohorts ( 84 total primary tumors) as well as 18 HPV(-) HNCs to discover subtypes and begin to characterize the differences between the subtypes in terms of their HPV characteristics pathway activity whole-genome somatic copy number variations and mutation frequencies. Results: We identified two distinctive HPV(+) subtypes by unsupervised clustering. Membership in the HPV(+) subtypes correlates with genic viral integration status E2/E4/E5 expression levels and the ratio of spliced to full length HPV oncogene E6. The subtypes also show differences in copy number alterations in particular the loss of chr16q and gain of chr3q PIK3CA mutation and in the expression of genes involved in several biological processes related to cancer including immune response oxidation-reduction process and keratinocyte and mesenchymal differentiation. Conclusion: Our characterization of two subtypes of HPV(+) tumors provides valuable molecular level information in relation to the alternative paths to tumor development and to that of HPV(-) HNCs. Together these results will shed light on stratifications of the HPV(+) HNCs and will help to guide personalized care for HPV(+) HNC patients.,Homo sapiens,RNA-Seq,27091409 30061624,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE74927,36,,,,,Y,Y,Y,,Y,,,,,,,,,4,
